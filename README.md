Traces packages APIv1
---------------------

This ActionScript package provides a basic API for activity trace
storage and access. It defines a basic data model (Obsel, Trace),
which allows to instrument an actionscript application to capture and
display traces. Obsels can be un/serialized from/to RDF Turtle syntax or
from/to a JSON structure.
A concise API is provided to ease trace collection: it consists of a
single `Trace.trace()` static method.

This is a transitionary package, current developments are made on the
v2 of the API called ktbs4as, available at https://github.com/ktbs/ktbs4as
